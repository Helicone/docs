## How PromptZero works

PromptZero provides a similar user experience as [Dream Studio](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream), however we provide free and open source tools that allow users to quickly get started building their own products that can easily scale.

We do this by allowing all requests to run on your own [client node](/docs/writing-plugins) or on PromptZero's [cloud platform](https://promptzero.com/cloud-platform) all behind the same easy to use [GraphQL api](/docs/graph-ql).

## Using PromptZero UI

Users can easily access the PromptZero UI by [signing up](https://promptzero.com/register).

### Requesting an Image

When you request an image it gets queued, and is processed in the background.
