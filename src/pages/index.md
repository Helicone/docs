## How bunkio works

PromptZero provides a similar user experience as [Dream Studio](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream), however we provide free and open source tools that allow users to quickly get started building their own products that can easily scale.

We do this by allowing all requests to run on your own [client node](/docs/writing-plugins) or on our [cloud platform](https://promptzero.com/cloud-platform).

## Using our UI

Users can easily access our UI by [signing up](https://promptzero.com/sign-up).

### Understanding the queue

Each image you request will be queued and not actually ran until you set up a worker to execute these jobs.

Here you have two options

1. [Run your own client](/docs/host-yourself)
1. [Subscribe to PromptZero Cloud](https://promptzero.com/cloud-platform)

## Using our API

After you have [generated your API key](/docs/generating-api-key) the rest is easy!

You can choose to

## Quick start for **free** using your own hardware!

{% callout link="kjasd" type="installation" title="Are you a PromptZero cloud subscriber?" %}
_Skip this section and go straight to [Quick start API](#quick-start-api)_.
{% /callout %}

### Generating worker API Keys

First you will need to [generate an API key](/docs/generating-api-key) and just make sure that the `worker` permission is toggled on.

### M1 mac

Requirements: 8 Gigs of RAM

```bash
brew install prompt_zero
prompt_zero run --api_key <API_KEY>
```

### Windows or Linux with an Nvidia GPU

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

```bash
sudo docker run -it --gpus=all --env API_KEY=<API_KEY> --env PROMPT_ZERO_URL=https://www.promptzero.com chitalian/prompt_zero-client:0.0.1 bash -c "conda run --no-capture-output -n ldm python prompt_zero.py"
```

### Using RunPod

RunPod offers secure GPU rentals with a single click config. You can rent a A4000 for about ~0.20 USD/hour. This is by far the cheapest option we have found. There is also an officially support template, so you can simply make an account and select `PromptZero` as a template. Paste in your API Key and deploy!
