## Edit the docs

PromptZero is quickly evolving and typically with docs, things become slightly out of date.
If you see any issues please report them on the [github repository for these docs](https://github.com/PromptZero/docs), or feel free to submit a pull request! ðŸ’ª

## Improve the worker

PromptZero's worker is open source and integrates with the [worker graphQL API](/docs/graph-ql).

Please file any issues or feature suggestions on the [worker repo](https://github.com/PromptZero/worker).
