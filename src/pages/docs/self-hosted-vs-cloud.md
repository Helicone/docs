title: Self hosted vs cloud

## What's the difference?

Self hosted allows you to run your workers locally on your own hardware. This allows you to use PromptZero completely Free! This is great for getting started using our API and building small prototypes. While PromptZero Cloud is a serverless pay as you go platform that automatically scales to your workload.

## Cloud

Get started with as low as $1 for 50 minutes of compute which is over 100 images!
PromptZero cloud uses the same interface and APIs as the self hosted version however it is super easy to setup and is super cheap.

### Pay as you go

The cloud platform is a pay as you go model, where you simply just pay for the time you are using PromptZero's infrastructure.

## Self hosted

PromptZero open sources it's workers, and allows it's users to host their own infrastructure with their own workers. This means if you have an extra GPU lying around or if you wanna use a cloud worker like RunPods or Lambda Labs you can do so.

### Free market competition

Having a self hosted solution ensures that PromptZero will always give a competitive price for hosting GPUs and allows you to build your
own server infrastructure and just use PromptZero as an API middleware and caching layer.

### Privacy

The self hosted version will soon include a full end to end encrypted solution where each of the workers and clients have private keys that are never stored on our servers meaning that you can create prompts and results in a completely encrypted manner where not even PromptZero can decipher what prompts and images are stored.

## Which one is right for you?

### Cloud

- If you want something running quick without any additional setup
- If you want to scale your product

### Self hosted

- If you are technically inclined.
- If you want to experiment with PromptZero but the Cloud infra
- If you want to work on specific hardware that PromptZero does not support
