## What can API key be used for?

Creating API keys allow you to access PromptZero outside of the UI and allows you to fully automate your usage of PromptZero ðŸš€.

Keys are used for 3 different supported use cases

1. Read: To view your prompts and image results.
2. Write: To add new prompts to your queue.
3. Worker: To execute your own workers if you are [self hosting your own workers](/docs/self-hosted-client).

## Creating API key

Go to [Settings -> Developer](https://promptzero.com/settings/developer) page to get started.
